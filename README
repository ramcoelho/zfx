Welcome do zfx.

This project extends ZendFramework's zf script by adding database reverse engineering capabilities.

Make sure to configure your environment by listing the parent directories for zf and zfx on system's PATH and ZendFramework's library directory on include_path (php.ini).
Remember your "zf.sh" script could be named just "zf" on your system. Please adjust the examples below if it is the case.

How you use it:

1. Create a ZF project with the regular zf script:
	$ zf.sh create project myproject

2. Configure a ZendDb adapter from within the root of your project:
	$ cd myproject
	$ zf.sh configure db-adapter "adapter=Pdo_Pgsql&host=localhost&username=user&password=secret&dbname=catalog"

3. Run zfx from within the root of your project:
	$ zfx

That's all! Have a nice coding!

I have tested this on Ubuntu 10.10 and PostgreSQL. If it works for you on a different setup, please send and e-mail to: ram.coelho AT gmail DOT com.
